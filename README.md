# Customers behavior
This project was done during a course, sponsored by Santander, available on a platform of Ubiqum Code Academy 
and relates to analysis and prediction of customers behaviour. We are working for an imaginary Blackwell Electronics Company, which sells electronic components.
Data we have recived contains 5 columns and 80 000 observations. All attributes are listed below:

* "in-store": an information if transaction was made online or in-store (0 - online, 1 - in-store),
* "age": age of customers (continous data),
* "items": number of items purchased (from 1 to 8),
* "amount": amount clients has spent (continous data),
* "region": a region, where transaction was made:
    * 1 - the North,
    * 2 - the South,
    * 3 - the East,
    * 4 - the West.
    
Project is divided into two parts. In the first one called "Customer buying patterns" we will focus on three questions:
* Do customers in different regions spend more per transaction? Which regions spend the most/least?
* Is there a relationship between number of items purchased and amount spent?
* Are there any other insights about customer purchasing behaviour?

Therefore we are visualizing data and making a correlation matrix to make some initial insights about relations between variables.

In the second part will trying to predict:
* the age of a customer in a region based on other demographic data,
* if a customer will buy online or in our stores.
